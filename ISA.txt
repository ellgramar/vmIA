32 bit computer

r0-r15:  GPRs (capable of load/store)
special purpose registers:
r16     PC (program counter)
r17     SP (stack pointer)
r18     LR (link register)
r19     FP (frame pointer)
r20     SR (status register)
         nzct xxxx xxxx xxxx
            n   indicates that the resulting value is negetive
            z   indicates that the result of the operation resulted in zero
            c   indicates that there was a carry or overflow
            t   indicates that in signed integers, there was an overflow


First 4 bits are the Instruction (INST)
